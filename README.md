## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I wanted to complete this project without the use of any libraries or frameworks, just HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. I learned when and where certain frameworks can be useful and the value of having a solid plan with design pattern / architecture laid out before beginning.
